## Purpose

As GPU prices fluctuate over time‚Äîaffected by hardware releases, mining booms, and supply shortages‚Äîthis tool aims to model these trends using sequential data. The core objective is to **predict future prices** for specific GPU models and years using LSTM networks trained on real-world price data.

## Model Performance

The model reaches a training loss (MSE) of approximately **0.014** after just 100 epochs, indicating it learns trends well from the normalized price data. This performance makes it suitable for general trend prediction even across unseen GPUs.
