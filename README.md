# OracleGPU – Graphics Card Price Predictor

OracleGPU is a deep learning-powered desktop application that predicts both **retail** and **used prices** of graphics cards based on historical data using an LSTM neural network.

## Purpose

As GPU prices fluctuate over time—affected by hardware releases, mining booms, and supply shortages—this tool aims to model these trends using sequential data. The core objective is to **predict future prices** for specific GPU models and years using LSTM networks trained on real-world price data.

## Documentation

Throughout this journey, we made documentation to go further in detail of the process of creating OracleGPU. You can find this here -> https://docs.google.com/document/d/14SOWcOzCcc5ZYIKYrKVYrhSmEw9-TIirW8DFNet-h1w/edit?usp=sharing

## Model Performance

The model reaches a training loss (MSE) of approximately **0.014** after just 100 epochs, indicating it learns trends well from the normalized price data. This performance makes it suitable for general trend prediction even across unseen GPUs.
